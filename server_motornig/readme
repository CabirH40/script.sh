# 🖥️ Server Monitoring Scripts

This folder contains lightweight Bash scripts used for monitoring and supervising server health and availability.

## 📁 Structure

- `server_motornig/`
  - Contains scripts for checking server uptime, status, and performing basic health checks.

## 🔧 Use Case

- The **folder must be placed on the main server** (Server A).
- The **monitoring script (`agent.sh`) should run on the monitoring server** (Server B).
- Agent connects to Server A via SSH to perform health checks or monitor specific processes.

## 📋 Requirements

- Linux environment (Ubuntu/Debian recommended)
- Bash shell
- SSH access between monitoring server and target server
- Basic tools: `curl`, `ping`, `top`, `grep`, `awk`

## 🚀 Installation

### 🔸 On the **main server (Server A)**

This is the server you want to monitor.

1. No installation needed.
2. Just make sure the scripts folder (`server_motornig/`) is available.
3. Ensure SSH access is allowed from the monitoring server (Server B).

### 🔸 On the **monitoring server (Server B)**

This server will run the scripts that connect to Server A.

```bash
# Navigate to a working directory
cd /opt/

# Clone the GitHub repo
git clone https://github.com/CabirH40/scripts.git

# Go to the monitoring scripts folder
cd scripts/server_motornig

# Make all scripts executable
chmod +x *.sh

# ▶️ Usage
Run the monitoring agent manually:
./agent.sh

Or schedule it with cron (e.g., every 5 minutes):
*/5 * * * * /opt/scripts/server_motornig/agent.sh >> /var/log/server_monitor.log 2>&1
#📌 Notes
Ensure passwordless SSH access is set up between Server B and Server A for smooth operation.

You can extend the script to:

Send Telegram alerts

Restart crashed services

Store logs to an external database

Modify thresholds inside the scripts as per your needs.
